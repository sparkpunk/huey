# Huey Color Palette Generator

Consistent color palettes from a single color input.

### How do I use it?

1. Add your brand color as the starting hex.
2. Choose the number of total hue families for your palette. Generally, it's better to put in more than you'll need, as it will allow you to see the differences between, say, different variants of yellow (which has a very narrow range of hues in the HSL/HSV color modes).
3. Choose the number of tints (veering towards white) and shades (veering towards black) each hue family should have (recommended: between 8 and 12).
4. Lastly, colors can be scaled by different mechanisms. Play around to see which one produces the smoothest steps for your palette.

**Don't forget to test for color deficiencies!**
